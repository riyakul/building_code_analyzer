# IFC Code Analyzer üèóÔ∏è

A Streamlit web application for analyzing building components from IFC files and building codes. The application provides a comprehensive interface to search and view building code requirements, component specifications, and relationships based on IFC schema.

## Features

- **Component Search**: Natural language search for building components and their requirements
- **Building Code Integration**: Access building code requirements for various components
- **Multiple Locations**: Support for different jurisdictions (California, New York, Texas, International)
- **IFC Schema Support**: Comprehensive IFC schema implementation including:
  - Architectural Elements (Walls, Windows, Doors, etc.)
  - MEP Components (Pipes, Ducts, Light Fixtures, etc.)
  - Spatial Elements (Spaces, Zones)
  - Structural Elements (Beams, Columns, Slabs)
- **Code Requirement Display**: Detailed view of building code requirements with references
- **Unit Management**: Automatic unit conversion between metric and imperial systems
- **File Upload**: Support for IFC and JSON file uploads with custom specifications

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/building_code_analyzer.git
cd building_code_analyzer
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run ifc_analyzer.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Use the application:
   - Select your location from the sidebar
   - Enter search queries in the search box
   - Upload IFC or JSON files for custom specifications
   - View component requirements and specifications

## Search Examples

- "Show me wall requirements"
- "What are the door dimensions"
- "Show me fire rating requirements for columns"
- "What are the ventilation requirements for spaces"
- "Show me sprinkler spacing requirements"
